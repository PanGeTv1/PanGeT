A decade after the concept of Pan-genome was first introduced, research in this field has spread its tentacles to areas such as pathogenesis of diseases, bacterial evolutionary studies and drug resistance. Gene content-based differentiation of virulent and avirulent strains of bacteria and identification of pathogen specific genes is indispensable to understand their physiology and gain insights into the mechanism of genome evolution. Subsequently, this will aid in identifying diagnostic targets and in developing and selecting vaccines. The root of pan-genomic studies, however, is to identify the core genes, dispensable genes and strain specific genes across genomes belonging to a clade. To this end, we have developed a tool, "PanGeT: A Pan-Genomics Tool" to compute the 'pan-genome' based on comparisons at the genome as well as the proteome levels. This automated tool is implemented using LaTeX libraries for effective visualization of overall pan-genome through graphical plots. Links to retrieve sequence information and functional annotations have also been provided.
